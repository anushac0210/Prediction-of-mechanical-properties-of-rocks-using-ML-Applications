This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the mechanical properties of rocks, specifi- cally the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Elasticity and Brazilian Tensile Strength. The study employs various ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Back propogation Artificial Neural Network (BPNN), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression. The research utilizes a dataset comprising indirect parameters such as density,porosity, p- wave velocity, and point load strength index as inputs to train and evaluate the performance of the selected machine learning models. The models undergo rigorous comparison and analysis to identify the most effective approach for predicting UCS, Elasticity and Brazilian Tensile Strength. Based on the findings from parallel test results, it can be concluded that SVM is particularly advanta- geous, especially when dealing with large-scale problems. This preference stems from the high efficiency of its solution procedure, making SVM a favorable choice for addressing challenges associated with extensive datasets or complex computational tasks.
